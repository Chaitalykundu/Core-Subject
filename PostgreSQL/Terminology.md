# Open-Source

Open-source refers to software whose source code is freely available to the public. Anyone can view, modify, distribute, and contribute to the code, making it a collaborative and transparent approach to software development.

&nbsp;

### Examples of Open-Source Software

- Operating Systems – Linux, Ubuntu, FreeBSD
- Web Browsers – Mozilla Firefox, Chromium
- Databases – PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- Programming Languages & Tools – Python, Node.js, Git, - VS Code
- Machine Learning & AI – TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV

# Object-Relational Database Management System

An Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS) is a database system that combines the features of:

- **Relational Database Management Systems** (RDBMS) (like MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** (like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)

This allows an ORDBMS to handle complex data types (e.g., images, JSON, XML, geospatial data) while still supporting SQL-based relational operations.

&nbsp;

### Examples of ORDBMS

- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- IBM Db2
- Informix
