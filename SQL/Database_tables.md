## Database Tables

* A database most often contains one or more tables. 
* Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). 
* Tables contain records (rows) with data.


&nbsp;

* To create a database
    > CREATE database database_name;
N.B. : SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive

## Semicolon after SQL Statements

* Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
* Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
