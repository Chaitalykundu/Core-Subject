# Creating an account

An account can be created by an organization administrator (i.e. a user with the **ORGADMIN** role) **through the web interface or using SQL**

Snowsight ==> Select Admin » Accounts » + Account.

&nbsp;

When creating an account, you can specify a **cloud platform**, a **region**, and a **Snowflake edition**. You can optionally specify a region group if you have, or want to have, accounts in multiple region groups. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Note

- By default, the maximum number of On Demand accounts in an organization is **25**. If the organization has a capacity contract, the default maximum number of accounts is **100**.

- You can only create an account in a region that is enabled for your organization. To request access to additional regions, contact Snowflake Support.

- It takes about **30 seconds** for the DNS changes to propagate before you can access a newly created account. If the account is not accessible immediately, wait for approximately 30 seconds and try again.
