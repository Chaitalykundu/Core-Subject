# Stage

A stage specifies where data files are stored (i.e. “staged”) so that the data in the files can be loaded into a table.

# Types of internal stages

Snowflake supports the following types of internal stages:

- User
- Table
- Named

&nbsp;

By default, each user and table in Snowflake is automatically allocated an internal stage for staging data files to be loaded. In addition, you can create named internal stages.
