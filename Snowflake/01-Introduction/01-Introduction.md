# Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud data platform that offers data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, and more.

It's designed to be more flexible, faster, and easier to use than traditional data warehouses.

Snowflake's architecture is built for the cloud and uses a new SQL database engine instead of existing database or "big data" software platforms. It's built on Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure.

# About Snowflake

- **_Build for the cloud_**

  - Build from scratch (cloud-native), optimize for cloud(AWS, GCP, Azure), storage and compute is decoupled

  - All kinds of use cases are supported ( Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Data Engineering, Streaming, Data Application, Data Science, Data Exchange)

  - Share data to internal as well as external customers sequrely.

- **_Software as a Service (SaaS)_**

  - No software, infrastructure, or upgrades to manage.

  - All update, maintenance and releases are done by snowflake and it is available for all the customers autometically
  - Available in all 3 major cloud providers

- **_Pay only for used compute and storage_**

  - Storage and Compute charged independently and only for storage
  - If you store TB's of data and no processign, you only need to pay for storage, not for computing.

- **_Scalable_**
  - Virtual warehouse enables computing scaling independently from storage
  - The scalability is virtually unlimited and Storage and Compute both can scale as needed and independent from each other

# Snowflake's features include

- <u>**Decoupled architecture**</u>: Snowflake's architecture has three decoupled layers: storage, compute, and cloud services.

- <u>**Elastic scalability**</u>: Snowflake can scale on demand to meet different workloads.

- <u>**Snowflake Horizon**</u>: A built-in governance solution to manage security, compliance, privacy, interoperability, and access to data and apps.

- <u>**Data engineering**</u>: Build reliable, continuous data pipelines at scale.

- <u>**Query processing layer**</u>: A layer that provides the means for executing various SQL statements. It consists of multiple independent compute clusters with nodes processing queries in parallel. Snowflake calls these clusters virtual warehouses.

# The value of Cloud Data Platform

- Unlimited Performance and scale
- One platform, one copy of data, and many workloads
- Secure governed access to all data
- Near-zero maintenance as a service

&nbsp;
