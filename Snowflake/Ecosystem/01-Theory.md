# Snowflake Ecosystem

The Snowflake Ecosystem is made up of so many partners and connectors that itâ€™s hard to keep up.

Some technology partners have joined with Snowflake to create an in-account Snowflake wizard called Partner Connect. Many other technology partners can be configured using ODBC, JDBC or other programmatic connections. Some technology partners offer SaaS solutions, some offer on-premise software and others still are hybrid on-premise and cloud solutions.

Snowflake has 2 kind of partners.

1. Service partner
2. Partner connect
